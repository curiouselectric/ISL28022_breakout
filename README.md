# ISL28022_breakout
This is a breakout board for the ISL28022 DC Power monitoring IC with I2C

The ISL28022 from Renesas has a datasheet available here: https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/amplifiers-buffers/all-amplifiers/digital-power-monitors/device/ISL28022.html

It is a DC power monitoring IC, which measures current and voltage and calculates power. The data is read at either 14 or 15 bit resolution. Data can be obtained via an I2C connection.

The maximum voltage is 60V DC and the current can be up to 320mV measured across a current shunt.

This folder contains the PCB design files for a simple break out board which can be connected to a microcontroller of your choice.
